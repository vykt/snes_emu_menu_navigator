# menu_navigator
This repository is part of the Raspberry Pi/Gentoo SNES Emulator project.

A boot menu written in C & ncurses for a unux environment. Takes a /dev/jsX device file as input, allows it to
control ROM file selection on a drawn menu. The user can then launch the selected ROM in snes9x (through xorg).


TODO:

-Include system architecture tutorial here or on the main project page (inprog)
-Include example config file.
